Question: Explain each of the following examples, and correct any problems you detect. 

(a) while (string::iterator iter != s.end()) { /* . . . */ }
(b) while (bool status = find(word)) { /* . . . */ } 
    if (!status) { /* . . . */ }

Answer:

(a): while you haven't reached the end of the string, execute the loop
(b): Error as status is defined in control structure, should be:

bool status;
while (status = find(word)) { /* . . . */ }
if (!status) { /* . . . */ }

Checks to see if a word can be found, while it can be found execute the while statement, when the word can't be found, execute the if statement.
