Question: Use the comma operator (ยง 4.10, p. 157) to rewrite the while loop from ยง 1.4.1 (p. 11) so that it no longer requires a block. Explain whether this rewrite improves or diminishes the readability of this code.

Code:

while (val <= 10) {
    sum += val;  // assigns sum + val to sum
    ++val;       // add 1 to val
}

Answer:

while (val <= 10)
	sum += val, ++val;

Diminishes the readability of the code as the sequence of operations is less clear.
