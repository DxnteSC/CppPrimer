Question: The last example in this section that jumped back to begin could be better written using a loop. Rewrite the code to eliminate the goto.

Code: begin:
    int sz = get_size();
    if (sz <= 0) {
          goto begin;
    }

Answer: for (int i = get_size(); i <= 0;;) {
		i = get_size();

	int i = get_size();
	while (i <= 0) {
		i = get_size();
