Question: Explain each of the following loops. Correct any problems you detect.

Code: 

(a) do
    	int v1, v2;
    	cout << "Please enter two numbers to sum:" ;
    	if (cin >> v1 >> v2)
        	cout << "Sum is: " << v1 + v2 << endl;
    while (cin); 

(b) do {
    	// . . .
    } while (int ival = get_response());

(c) do {
    	int ival = get_response();
    } while (ival);

Answer: 

(a): sums two numbers while there is input, need {} around the statements in the do condition.

(b): declaration done in do condition not allowed.

(c): infinite loop as a new condition is defined every loop.
