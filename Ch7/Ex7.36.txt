Question: The following initializer is in error. Identify and fix the problem.

Code: 

struct X {
	X (int i, int j): base(i), rem(base % j) { }
	int rem, base;
};

Answer: rem is initialised before base, therefore rem is undefined as base is not initialised yet. To fix the constructor:

X(int i, int j): base(i), rem(i % j) {}
