Question: Using our first version of Sales_data from ยง 2.6.1 (p. 72), explain the following initialization. Identify and fix any problems.

Code:

struct Sales_data {
    std::string bookNo;
    unsigned units_sold = 0;
    double revenue = 0.0;
};

Sales_data item = {"978-0590353403", 25, 15.99};

Answer:

Problem is that units_sold and revenue are in class initialised, therefore the class is not an aggregate class. This means that item can not be initialised using a braced list. To fix, remove the initialisation of units_sold and revenue.
