Question: Which, if any, of the following static data member declarations and definitions are errors? Explain why.

Code: 

// example.h
class Example {
public:
    static double rate = 6.5; // Error 1
    static const int vecSize = 20;
    static vector<double> vec(vecSize); // Error 2
};

// example.C
#include "example.h"
double Example::rate; // Error 3
vector<double> Example::vec; // Error 4

Answer:

Error 1: cannot initialise a static member inside the class.
Error 2: cannot use brackets for in-class initialiser, and static member should be initialised outside of class.
Error 3 and Error 4: need to initialise static members.
