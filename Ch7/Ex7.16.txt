Question: What, if any, are the constraints on where and how often an access specifier may appear inside a class definition? What kinds of members should be defined after a public specifier? What kinds should be private?

Answer: There aren't any constraints on where or how often an access specifier may appear inside a class. Members that should be defined after a public specifier should be part of the class interface. Members that should be defined after a private specifier should be part of the class implementation.
