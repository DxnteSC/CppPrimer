Question: Which, if any, of the following statements are untrue? Why? 

(a) A class must provide at least one constructor. 
(b) A default constructor is a constructor with an empty parameter list. 
(c) If there are no meaningful default values for a class, the class should not provide a default constructor. 
(d) If a class does not define a default constructor, the compiler generates one that initializes each data member to the default value of its associated type.

Answer:

(a): False, a class can provide no constructors, all member variables in the class are default initialised by the default constructor provided by the compiler.

(b): False, a default constructor can have a parameter list with in which all parameters have default values.

(c): False, generally good practice to define default constructors for all classes.

(d): True, if possible.
