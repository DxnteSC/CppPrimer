Question: For each of the three following declarations of combine, explain what happens if we call i.combine(s), where i is a Sales_data and s is a string: 

(a) Sales_data &combine(Sales_data); 
(b) Sales_data &combine(Sales_data&); 
(c) Sales_data &combine(const Sales_data&) const;

Answer:

(a): s is converted into a temporary Sales_data and then copied as the parameter of combine.

(b): error, s is converted into a temporary Sales_data but a reference to a temporary is an error.

(c): error, function shouldn't be const as it is attempting to change i.
