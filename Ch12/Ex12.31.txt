Question: What difference(s) would it make if we used a vector instead of a set to hold the line numbers? Which approach is better? Why?

Answer: The vector would be unordered, also if a word occurred multiple times in the same line it would be duplicated, whereas items in a set are unique and ordered. Sets are better as they are already ordered, and there is no need for extra code to handle duplicates.
