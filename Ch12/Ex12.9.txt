Question: Explain what happens in the following code:

Code: 
int *q = new int(42), *r = new int(100); (a)
r = q; (b)
auto q2 = make_shared<int>(42), r2 = make_shared<int>(100); (c)
r2 = q2; (d)

Answer:

(a): q points to a dynamically allocated int with value 42, r points to a dynamically allocated int with value 100. 
(b): r now points to the same memory as q, causes a memory leak as the memory r used to point to isn't freed.
(c): q2 is a shared_ptr<int> with value 42, r2 is a shared_ptr<int> with value 100. 
(d): reference count for the memory r2 used to point to decreases, the memory r2 used to point too is freed, r2 now points to the same memory as q2, reference count for the memory q2 points to increases,
