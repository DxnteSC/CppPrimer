Question: What happens if we execute the following code?

Code:
auto sp = make_shared<int>();
auto p = sp.get();
delete p;

Answer:

The memory that sp points to is freed when delete p is called, meaning sp become a dangling pointer and when the reference count to sp reaches 0, it will attempt to free memory which has already been freed.
