Question: We could have written StrBlobPtrâ€™s deref member as follows:


(1):
std::string& deref() const
{ return (*check(curr, "dereference past end"))[curr]; }

Instead of: 

(2):
std::string StrBlobPtr::deref() const
{
    auto p = check(curr,"Deference past end");
    return (*p)[curr];
}

Which version do you think is better and why?


Answer: 2 is better as it is clearer to read, despite 1 being less code, it is more difficult to read and more error prone.
