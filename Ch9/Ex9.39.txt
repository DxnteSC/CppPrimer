Question: Explain what the following program fragment does:

Code: 

vector<string> svec;
svec.reserve(1024);
string word;
while (cin >> word)
        svec.push_back(word);
svec.resize(svec.size()+svec.size()/2);

Answer: Creates an empty vector, svec, which holds elements of type string. Reserves 1024 bytes in memory for spec. Checks for input and adds those words to svec. Resizes svec to be 1.5x larger after finishing input and adds half the size of the vector as empty strings to the back.
