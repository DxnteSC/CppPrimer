Question: Assuming iv is a vector of ints, what is wrong with the following program? How might you correct the problem(s)?

Code: 

vector<int>::iterator iter = iv.begin(),
                      mid = iv.begin() + iv.size()/2;
while (iter != mid)
    if (*iter == some_val)
        iv.insert(iter, 2 * some_val); // a
    ++iter

Answer: the value of tier never changes, and insert doesn't support args, to fix, change line a to iter = iv.emplace(iter, 2 * some_val); and add line b
