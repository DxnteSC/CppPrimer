Question: Why donâ€™t list or array have a capacity member?

Answer: Lists don't have capacity members as there elements are not stored contiguously, therefore there is no reason to pre-allocate space in memory. Arrays don't have capacity members as they are a fixed size, therefore they always take up the same amount of space in memory.
