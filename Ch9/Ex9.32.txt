Question: In the program onpage 354 would it be legal to write the call to insert as follows? If not, why not?

iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter++);

Call to insert in program: 

iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter);

Answer:

It is legal but may invalidate the program logic, this is because the order of evaluation of arguments is undefined, therefore the *iter++ may occur first, resulting in the odd number not being duplicated.
