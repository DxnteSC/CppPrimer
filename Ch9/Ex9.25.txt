Question: In the program on page 349 that erased a range of elements, what happens if elem1 and elem2 are equal? What if elem2 or both elem1 and elem2 are the off-the-end iterator?

Answer: If elem1 and elem2 are equal, then no value is deleted. If elem2 is an off-the-end iterator then all the elements from elem1 tot he end of the list are erased, if both are off-the-end iterators, than nothing happens.
