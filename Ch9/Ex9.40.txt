Question: If the program in the previous exercise reads 256 words, what is its likely capacity after it is resized? What if it reads 512? 1,000? 1,048?

Code: 

vector<string> svec;
svec.reserve(1024);
string word;
while (cin >> word)
        svec.push_back(word);
svec.resize(svec.size()+svec.size()/2);

Answer:
At 256 and 512, it's likely capacity is still 1024. At 1000, it's capacity is at least 1500, but more likely greater and at 1048, it's capacity is likely to be 1572, but again is more likely to be greater.
