Question: What is wrong with the following program? How might you correct it?

Code: 
list<int> lst1;
list<int>::iterator iter1 = lst1.begin(),
                    iter2 = lst1.end();
while (iter1 < iter2) /* ... */

Answer: Can't use relational operator '<' on list<>::iterator. To correct the code change list to a vector, deque, string or array. Or change the relational operator in the condition statement to !=
