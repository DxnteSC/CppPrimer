front_inserter: calls push_front on the container, if the container supports it; reverses the order of the list; takes one argument;

back_inserter: calls push_back on the container, if the container supports it; keeps the order of the list the same; takes one argument.

inserter: calls insert on the container; keeps the order of the list the same; takes two arguments.
