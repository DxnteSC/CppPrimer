Question: List the five iterator categories and the operations that each supports.

Answer: 

Input - prefix and postfix increment; deference, only on the left hand side of an assignment and arrow operator.

Output - prefix and postfix increment; deference, only on the left hand side.

Forward iterator - same as input and output, but can read or write the same element multiple times.

Bidirectional iterator - same as forward, also supports prefix and postfix decrement.

Random access iterator - same as bidirectional but also supports relational operators; addition and subtraction on iterators and integral types; subtraction between iterators; and subscript notation.
