Question: Do you think the TextQuery and QueryResult classes need to define their own versions of the copy-control members? If so, why? If not, why not? Implement whichever copy-control operations you think these classes require.

Answer: No, as the default functionality correctly assigns, copies and destroys member variables properly, so unless there is a specific different functionality from the default required, defined versions of the copy-control is unnecessary.
