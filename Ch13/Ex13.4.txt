Question: Assuming Point is a class type with a public copy constructor, identify each use of the copy constructor in this program fragment:

Code: 

Point global;
Point foo_bar(Point arg) (1)
{
    Point local = arg (2), *heap = new Point(global); (3)
    *heap = local; (2)
    Point pa[ 4 ] = { local, *heap }; (4)
    return *heap; (5)
}
