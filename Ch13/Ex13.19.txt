Question: Does your Employee class need to define its own versions of the copy-control members? If so, why? If not, why not? Implement whatever copy-control members you think Employee needs.

Answer: Yes, as without defined version of the copy-control members, the employees will not have unique ID numbers but will instead have the ID number of the employee they copied. It doesn't need a defined destructor.
