Question: Why is the parameter to the save and remove members of Message a Folder&? Why didnâ€™t we define that parameter as Folder? Or const Folder&?

Answer: If we defined the parameter as Folder, then the message would be added to a copy of the folder, which would then be removed when out of scope, thereby resulting in the message not be added to the folder. If we defined it as a const Folder&, then we wouldn't be able to add messages to the folder.
