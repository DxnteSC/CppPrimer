Question: Our program does no checking on the validity of either input file. In particular, it assumes that the rules in the transformation file are all sensible. What would happen if a line in that file has a key, one space, and then the end of the line? Predict the behavior and then check it against your version of the program.

Answer: Throws the runtime error, which says there is no rule, if there are two spaces, however, the value at the the key is initialised with an empty string, thereby effectively removing that word from the transform.
