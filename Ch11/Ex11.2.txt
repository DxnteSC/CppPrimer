Question: Give an example of when each of list, vector, deque, map, and set might be most useful.

Answer: 

List - reading a fixed number of words, inserting them in the container alphabetically as they are entered (technically associative containers are better but...)
Vector - storing game objects which need to be kept track of
Deque - storing a software application's list of undo operations
Map - dictionary
Set - a collection of int values which are acceptable for a program.
