Question: Explain the meaning of the operand pos.first->second used in the output expression of the final program in this section.

Code: 

for (auto pos = authors.equal_range(search_item);
     pos.first != pos.second; ++pos.first)
    cout << pos.first->second << endl;

Answer: 

Derefences pos.first, which is the iterator to the pair with key search_item and returns the mapped_value of that pair, which is printed.
