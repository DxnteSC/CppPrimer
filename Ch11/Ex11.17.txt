Question: Assuming c is a multiset of strings and v is a vector of strings, explain the following calls. Indicate whether each call is legal:

Code: 

(a): copy(v.begin(), v.end(), inserter(c, c.end()));
(b): copy(v.begin(), v.end(), back_inserter(c));
(c): copy(c.begin(), c.end(), inserter(v, v.end()));
(d): copy(c.begin(), c.end(), back_inserter(v));

Answer: 

(a): Copies all of the elements from v into c, c is then reordered as sets are ordered.
(b): Copies all of the elements from v into the end of c. Illegal as associative containers to not support push_back.
(c): Copies all of the elements from c into the end of v.
(d): Copies all of the elements from c into the end of v.
