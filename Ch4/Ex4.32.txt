Question: Explain the following loop.

Code:

constexpr int size = 5;
int ia[size] = {1,2,3,4,5};
for (int *ptr = ia, ix = 0;
     ix != size && ptr != ia+size;
     ++ix, ++ptr)   { /* ...   */ }

Answer:

While ptr and ix are not pointing to the the end of ia, increment both of them and execute the loop
