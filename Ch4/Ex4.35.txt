Question: Given the following definitions, identify the implicit type conversions, if any, taking place: 

(a) cval = 'a' + 3; 
(b) fval = ui - ival * 1.0; 
(c) dval = ui * fval; 
(d) cval = ival + fval + dval;

Code: 
char cval;     
int ival;    
unsigned int ui;
float fval;   
double dval;

Answer:

(a): 'a' converted to an int, then added to 3, and then the value is converted back to a char.
(b): ival converted to a float, multiplied by 1.0, then the result is converted to an unsigned int, and subtracted from ui and then that result is converted to a float.
(c): depends on size of float and unsigned int but the value is converted to a double.
(d): ival converted to a float, and added to value of fval, the result is converted to a double and added to the value of dval, the result is then converted to a char.
