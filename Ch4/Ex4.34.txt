Question: Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what conversions take place in the following expressions: 

(a) if (fval) 
(b) dval = fval + ival; 
(c) dval + ival * cval;

Answer:

(a): fval is converted to a bool, false if fval is 0 and true if fval is non-zero.
(b): ival is converted to a float, then the result of fval and ival are converted to a double.
(c): cval is converted to an int, and then the result of ival * cval is converted to a double.
