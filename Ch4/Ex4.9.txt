Question: Explain the behaviour of the condition in the following if statement:

Code:

const char *cp = "Hello World";
if (cp && *cp)

Answer: cp is evaluated as the bool true, as it is a non-zero pointer, *cp is evaluated as the bool true as it is a non-empty string so the condition evaluates as true.
