Question: Our program that distinguished between high pass, pass, and fail depended on the fact that the conditional operator is right associative. Describe how that operator would be evaluated if the operator were left associative.

Answer: If the conditional operator was left associative then 

finalgrade = (grade > 90) ? "high pass"
                          : (grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass";

would be evaluated as

finalgrade = (grade > 90 ? "high pass" : grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass";

Which returns high pass if grade if greater than 90 and then returns fail, or if grade is less than 60 it returns fail, otherwise it returns pass.
