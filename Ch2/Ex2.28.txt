Explain the following definitions. Identify any that are illegal. 

(a) int i, *const cp; 
(b) int *p1, *const p2; 
(c) const int ic, &r = ic; 
(d) const int *const p3;
(e) const int *p;


Answer:

(a): illegal, i is an int, cp is a const pointer to an int which isn't initialised.

(b): illegal, p1 is a pointer to an int, p2 is a const pointer which isn't initialised.

(c): illegal, ic is a const int which is not initialised, r is a reference to a const int, ic.

(d): illegal, p3 is a const pointer to a const int which is not initialised. 

(e): legal, p is a pointer to a const int.
