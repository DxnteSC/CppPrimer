Question: Given the declarations in the previous exercise determine whether the following assignments are legal. Explain how the top-level or low-level const applies in each case.

Code: 

(a) r1 = v2;
(b) p1 = p2;    
(c) p2 = p1;
(d) p1 = p3;    
(e) p2 = p3;

Answer:

(a): legal, r1 is not const.

(b): illegal, p2 has low-level const, p1 does not.

(c): legal, can convert const int to int so can convert pointer to const int to a pointer to an int

(d): illegal, p3 has low-level const, p1 does not.

(e): legal, have the same low-level const
