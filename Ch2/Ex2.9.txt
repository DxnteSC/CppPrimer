Question: Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal, explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it. 

(a) std::cin >> int input_value; 
(b) int i = { 3.14 }; 
(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99; 
(d) int i = 3.14;

Answer:

(a): Error. The variable needs to be defined before being used for inout, to fix;
	int input_value;
	std::cin >> input_value;

(b): Error, narrowing conversion with list initialisation. Either initialise without the curly braces, or change the type to double. To fix;
	int i = 3.14 or double i = {3.14}

(c): Error, wage is an undeclared identifier. To fix;
	double salary, wage;
	salary = wage = 9999.99

(d): Initialises i to 3, as int truncates the value.
