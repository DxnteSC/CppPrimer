Question: Which of the following initializations are legal? Explain why. 

(a) int i = -1, &r = 0; 
(b) int *const p2 = &i2; 
(c) const int i = -1, &r = 0; 
(d) const int *const p3 = &i2; 
(e) const int *p1 = &i2; 
(f) const int &const r2; 
(g) const int i2 = i, &r = i;

Answer:

(a): illegal, non-const references cannot be initialised to literals.

(b): legal, p2 is a const pointer to type int.

(c): legal, const references can be assigned to literals.

(d): legal, p3 is a const pointer to a const int;

(e): legal, p1 is a pointer to a const int.

(f): illegal, const references need to be initialised.

(g): legal, i2 is a const int initialised to i, r is a reference to a const int.
