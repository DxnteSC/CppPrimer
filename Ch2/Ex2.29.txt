(a) i = ic; 
(b) p1 = p3; 
(c) p1 = &ic; 
(d) p3 = &ic; 
(e) p2 = p1; 
(f) ic = *p3;

Answer: 

(a): legal, int can be initialised with value of ic.
(b): illegal, non-const pointer to an int trying to be assigned to a const pointer to a const int
(c): illegal, pointer to a non-const int attempting to point to a const int
(d): illegal, cannot change value of a const object
