Question: Using the variable definitions from this section, determine what happens in each of these assignments:

Code:

int main()
{
    int i = 0, &r = i;
    auto a = r;
    
    const int ci = i, &cr = ci;
    auto b = ci;
    auto c = cr;
    auto d = &i;
    auto e = &ci;
    auto &g = ci;
}

Assignments:

a = 42;   b = 42;   c = 42;
d = 42;   e = 42;   g = 42;

Answer:

(a): 42 assigned to value of a.

(b): 42 assigned to value of b.

(c): 42 assigned to value of c.

(d): Error, can't set value of int* to a literal.

(e): Error, can't set value of const int* to literal.

(g): Error, cannot change value of const
