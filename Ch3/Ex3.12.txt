Question: Which, if any, of the following vector definitions are in error? For those that are legal, explain what the definition does. For those that are not legal, explain why they are illegal. 

(a) vector<vector<int>> ivec; 
(b) vector<string> svec = ivec; 
(c) vector<string> svec(10, "null");

Answer:

(a): legal, creates an empty vector of element type vector which contains ints.
(b): illegal, copy initialisation for vectors need to be of the same type.
(c): legal, creates a vector which contains 10 strings which all say "null".
