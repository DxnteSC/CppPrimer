Question: Assuming txt_size is a function that takes no arguments and returns an int value, which of the following definitions are illegal? Explain why. 

unsigned buf_size = 1024; 
(a) int ia[buf_size]; 
(b) int ia[4 * 7 - 14]; 
(c) int ia[txt_size()]; 
(d) char st[11] = "fundamental";

Answer:

(a): Illegal, buf_size not a constexpr.
(b): Legal, array is size 14.
(c): Legal as long as txt_size is const_expr, array is the size of whatever int txt_size returns.
(d): Illegal, no room for null string.
