Question: Which, if any, of the following calls are illegal? Why? Which, if any, are legal but unlikely to match the programmerâ€™s intent? Why?

Code: 

char *init(int ht, int wd = 80, char bckgrnd = ' '); 
(a) init(); 
(b) init(24,10); 
(c) init(14, '*');

Answer:

(a): Illegal, ht has no default argument passed therefore function can't be called without passing a value too ht.

(b): Legal

(c): Legal, but unlikely to match programmer's intent, '*' can be converted to an int, therefore value is passed to wd instead of being passed to bckgrnd which is more likely to be the intent.
