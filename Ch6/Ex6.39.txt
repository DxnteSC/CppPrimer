Question: Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of the following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal. 

(a)     int calc(int, int);
	int calc(const int, const int); 

(b)     int get();
	double get(); 

(c)     int *reset(int *);
	double *reset(double *);

Anser:

(a): Illegal, top-level const are ignored, therefore functions are the same
(b): Illegal, same name but different return type is not enough to distinguish.
(c) Legal, first one is used for pointers to ints, second one is used for pointers to doubles.
