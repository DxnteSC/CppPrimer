Question: Explain the rationale for the type of each of find_charâ€™s parameters In particular, why is s a reference to const but occurs is a plain reference? Why are these parameters references, but the char parameter c is not? What would happen if we made s a plain reference? What if we made occurs a reference to const?

Answer: s is a reference to const as the value of it does not need to be changed inside the function, , occurs is a plain reference as the value of it does need to be changed, s is a reference to avoid copying a potentially large object, occurs is a reference so that it can be returned along with the found character, where as c is only a char, therefore can be copied easily. If s was a plain reference nothing would happen, if occurs was a reference to const, an error would occur as within the function occurs is incremented.
