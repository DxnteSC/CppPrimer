Question: Assuming T is the name of a type, explain the difference between a function declared as void f(T) and void f(T&).

Answer: In void f(T), the function passes the argument by value, which means a copy of T is made. In void f(T&), the function passes the argument by reference, which means the same argument defined in the caller is used.
