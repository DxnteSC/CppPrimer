Question: Write three additional declarations for the function in the previous exercise. One should use a type alias, one should use a trailing return, and the third should use decltype. Which form do you prefer and why?

Answer:

1) 
using t = string[10]
t &func() {}

2)
auto func() -> string(&)[10] (preffered, easiest to write/remember and it looks nicer)

3)

string[10] t = {there are ten strings in this}
decltype(t) &func()
