Question: The following function, although legal, is less useful than it might be. Identify and correct the limitation on this function:

Code:
bool is_empty(string& s) { return s.empty(); }

Answer:
As the parameter of bool is empty is a non-const string, string literals and const strings cannot be passed as arguments, only string objects.

To correct the limitations, make string &s const.
