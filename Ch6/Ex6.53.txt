Question: Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of the following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal. 

(a) 	int calc(int&, int&); 
	int calc(const int&, const int&); 
(b) 	int calc(char*, char*); 
	int calc(const char*, const char*);
(c) 	int calc(char*, char*); 
	int calc(char* const, char* const);

Answer:

(a): second declaration takes references to const ints. 

(b): second declaration takes pointers to const chars.

(c): illegal, top level const is ignored, so function declarations are the same.
