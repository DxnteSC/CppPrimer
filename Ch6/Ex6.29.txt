Question: When you use an initializer_list in a range for would you ever use a reference as the loop control variable? If so, why? If not, why not?

Answer: Yes, as the type of the initializer_list can be object of large class types, therefore, using a reference avoids copying. But as the values of the initializer_list are always const, for small class types, a reference is unnecessary.
