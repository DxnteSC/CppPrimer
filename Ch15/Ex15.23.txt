Question: Assuming class D1 on page 620 had intended to override its inherited fcn function, how would you fix that class? Assuming you fixed the class so that fcn matched the definition in Base, how would the calls in that section be resolved?

Answer: remove the int parameter from D1's fcn(). The calls would now be resolved as:

bp2->fcn() would now call D1::fcn().
p2->fcn(42) would now be an error as D1 would have no fcn(int) function.
