Question: Explain any discrepancy in the sum generated by the this version and the previous program. If there is no discrepancy, explain why there isnâ€™t one.

Answer: The discrepancy occurs because the non-pointer vector slices off the bulk_quote part, therefore, no discounts are applied, whereas the with the pointer vector, the dynamic pointer type is still bulk_quote, therefore the discounts are applied.
