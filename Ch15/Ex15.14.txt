Question: Given the classes from the previous exercise and the following objects, determine which function is called at run time:

Code: 

base bobj;     base *bp1 = &bobj;   base &br1 = bobj;
derived dobj;  base *bp2 = &dobj;   base &br2 = dobj; 

(a) bobj.print(); 
(b) dobj.print(); 
(c) bp1->name(); 
(d) bp2->name(); 
(e) br1.print(); 
(f) br2.print();

Answer:

(a): base::print()
(b): derived::print()
(c): base::name()
(d): base::name()
(e): base::print()
(f): derived::print()
