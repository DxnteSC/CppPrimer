Question: When is it possible for an expression’s static type to differ from its dynamic type? Give three examples in which the static and dynamic type differ.

Answer: An expression’s static type can differ from its dynamic type if an argument expects a base class but is given a class that derives from said base class. E.g.:

class Base {/*...*/};
class Derived : public Base {/*...*/}
Derived d;
Base *b = &d;
Base &br = d;
Derived *dp = &d;
Base *b2 = dp;

b2, b and br have differnt static and dynamic types.
