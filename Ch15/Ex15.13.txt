Question: Given the following classes, explain each print function. If there is a problem in this code, how would you fix it?


Code: 

class base {
public:
   string name() { return basename; }
   virtual void print(ostream &os) { os << basename; }
private:
   string basename;
};

class derived : public base {
public:
   void print(ostream &os) { print(os); os << " " << i; }
private:
   int i;
};

Answer:

The call to print in derived calls its own print, leading to an infinite loop. Therefore to fix, the print in derived should be base::print(os); os << " " << i.
