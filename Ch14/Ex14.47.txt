Quesiton: Explain the difference between these two conversion operators: 
struct Integral 
{
    operator const int(); (a)
    operator int() const; (b)
};

Answer: 
(a) implicit conversion of Integral to a const int, return value is not const so can be changed.
(b) implicit conversion of Integral to an int, return value is const so can't be changed.
