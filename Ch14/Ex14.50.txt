Question: Show the possible class-type conversion sequences for the initializations of ex1 and ex2. Explain whether the initializations are legal or not.

Code: 
struct LongDouble 
{
    LongDouble(double = 0.0);
    operator double();
    operator float();
};
LongDouble ldObj;
int ex1 = ldObj; 
float ex2 = ldObj;

Answer:
ex1: ldObj -> double -> int oe ldObj -> float -> int; illegal as double and float are equally good matches.
ex2: ldObj -> float; legal, float is an exact match.
