Question: Show the conversion sequences (if any) needed to call each version of calc and explain why the best viable function is selected.

Code: 

struct LongDouble 
{
    LongDouble(double = 0.0);
    operator double();
    operator float();
};

void calc(int);
void calc(LongDouble);
double dval;
calc(dval); // which calc?

Answer: 
void calc(int): double -> int; best viable function as promoting double to int is better than converting double to LongDouble
void calc(LongDouble): double -> LongDouble; not used
