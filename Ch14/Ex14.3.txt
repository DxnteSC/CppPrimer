Both string and vector define an overloaded == that can be used to compare objects of those types. Assuming svec1 and svec2 are vectors that hold strings, identify which version of == is applied in each of the following expressions: 
(a) "cobble" == "stone" 
(b) svec1[0] == svec2[0] 
(c) svec1 == svec2 
(d) "svec1[0] == "stone"

Answer:

(a): string==
(b): overloaded string==
(c): overloaded vector==
(d): overloaded string==
