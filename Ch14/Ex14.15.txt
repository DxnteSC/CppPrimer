Question: Should the class you chose for exercise 7.40 from ยง 7.5.1 (p. 291) define any of the arithmetic operators? If so, implement them. If not, explain why not.

Answer: No arithmetic operators make sense for the Book class, as logically adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing books does not make sense.
